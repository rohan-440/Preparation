1 . Two pointers 

It is really an easy and effective technique that is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.

2 . Window Sliding Technique 

a) It is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity. It should have fixed size array

b) To know, Where we use the Sliding Window then we remember the following terms which is mentioned below:  Array, String, Sub Array,
                                 Sub String, Largest Sum,
                                 Maximum Sum, Minimum Sum
 
c) when a continuous sub array with exactly k  then no of sub array of exactly k = no of size of subarray of atmost k - no of size of sub array of atmost k-1 ;

d) when a continuous sub array with atleast k  then no of sub array of atleast k =  size of array - no of size of window size ;

e) Min/Max 
      for Max :
              sum = sum of all elements
              window = n-k;
              ans = max(ans,sum-window)
 f) to call sub matrix in matrix
   for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i+=3)
	for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j+=3)
